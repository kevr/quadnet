quadnet
-------

A graph quadrant neural network program. It is meant to take an input
`P` -- an `(x, y)` coordinate found on the cartesian plane and respond
with an output (1 - 4) indicating which quadrant the point lies in.

The table below shows the numbers used for the four different
quadrants in a cartesian graph.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td><td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td><td>4</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Examples

- Point `(1, 1)` lies in qudrant `1`
- Point `(-1, 1)` lies in quadrant `2`
- Point `(-1, -1)` lies in quadrant `3`
- Point `(1, -1)` lies in quadrant `4`
